# About
I'm trying ot make a very easy installation for Retroarch and other games or emulators for Raspberry Pi's OpenELEC.
It is based on originally created addon by Mezo in OpenELEC official forums, since then, a lot of changes are made by other users.


This is still a work in progress script.


### Installation instructions:

Connecto to your Raspberry Pi via ssh and type:

wget --no-check-certificate -O /storage/install-gamestarter.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bite-your-idols/gamestarter-openelec/master/install-gamestarter.sh

Then:

sh /storage/install-gamestarter.sh

relax and wait 5 minutes...
